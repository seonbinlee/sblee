Group Project Proposal


	Previous research in mental health shows some relationships between individual mental health and determinants like family income, social environment. Our group started to have interest in investigating if it¡¯s true and decided to test if there is any relationship between individual mental health and family income.

	With investigating above question we are going to see the questions below using R.
1)	What relationship does the average American family income exhibits in the mental health of an individual across different ethnic groups and gender in the country?
2)	Is there any association between the mental health and crime rate?
3)	What impact does the wages and salaries have on mental health of an individual?
4)	What social indicators contribute to decoration of mental health of average American?

	The limitation of this question is that there would be other factors that can affect family income not just mental health. To reduce this error when we conduct our project, we need to consider there always be other factors that influence dependent variable(income) 

	The subject that our group is trying to answer is already conducted by other investigating organization. Some survey proved that there is positive relationship between two factors. On the other hand, other survey showed that there is little relationship with these two variables. We will figure out which one is true and what other factors can influence the one¡¯s income.
